### Introduction to AWS Cloud Computing

#### Key AWS Services

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Provides scalable virtual servers for running applications, with pay-as-you-go pricing.
  
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Offers durable and scalable object storage for any amount of data, with high availability.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed relational databases with automated backups and scaling.

- **Analytics:** Tools like Amazon Redshift for data warehousing and Athena for serverless SQL queries on S3 data.

- **Networking & Content Delivery:** Services like Amazon VPC for isolated networks and CloudFront for global content delivery with low latency.

- **Developer Tools:** Tools like CodePipeline for automating software release, CodeBuild for testing, and CodeDeploy for deployment.

- **Machine Learning:** Services like SageMaker for building ML models and Rekognition for image and video analysis.

- **IoT:** AWS IoT Core for connecting and managing IoT devices, and IoT Analytics for processing data.

#### Benefits of AWS

- **On-demand Access:** Services available whenever needed.
  
- **Pay-as-you-go:** Costs based on usage with no upfront capital expenses.
