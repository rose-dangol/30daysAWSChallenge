## Introduction to AWS Cloud Computing

#### Six Benefits of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing offers several advantages that make it an attractive option for businesses of all sizes:

1. **Trade Upfront Expense for Variable Expense:** Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you'll use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources and pay only for how much you consume.

2. **Stop Spending Money to Run and Maintain Data Centers:** By using cloud computing, you can focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. This reduces the need for large investments in hardware and other resources.

3. **Stop Guessing Capacity:** With cloud computing, you donâ€™t need to predict your infrastructure capacity needs. You can access as much or as little as you need and scale up and down as required.

4. **Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale:** Cloud providers such as AWS have a vast infrastructure that allows you to benefit from the economies of scale, resulting in lower pay-as-you-go prices.

5. **Increase Speed and Agility:** The flexibility of cloud computing enables developers to experiment and innovate faster. You can deploy new applications more quickly, reducing the time it takes to bring them to market.

6. **Go Global in Minutes:** With cloud computing, you can easily deploy applications in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This reduces the latency and improves the experience for your customers, no matter where they are.

### Deploying to the Cloud

When deploying to the cloud, there are different service models and deployment strategies, each offering varying levels of control, flexibility, and management.

- **Service Models:**
  - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It gives you the most control over your infrastructure but requires more management.
  - **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Delivers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically those needed for application development. It abstracts much of the management, allowing you to focus on your applications.
  - **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Offers applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis. It handles everything from infrastructure to application, requiring minimal management.

- **Deployment Strategies:**
  - **Cloud:** All components run on the cloud. Applications are entirely deployed on the cloud infrastructure.
  - **Hybrid:** Combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources, allowing you to extend and connect your existing systems to the cloud.
  - **On-premises:** Everything runs in your own data center, sometimes referred to as "private cloud" but without the benefits of cloud computing.

Each model and strategy comes with a shared responsibility between you and the cloud provider, where the provider manages the security *of* the cloud infrastructure, and you manage security *in* the cloud.

### Cloud Computing Models

Understanding the different cloud computing models helps businesses choose the right service for their needs:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Offers fundamental compute, storage, and networking resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the infrastructure.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet, with providers managing everything from the underlying infrastructure to maintenance and support.
